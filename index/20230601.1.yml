  GITEX Africa Digital Summit, organized by the Dubai World Trade Center and the Ministry of Digital Transition and Administrative Reform of Morocco, took place in Marrakech, Morocco, from May 31 to June 2, 2023. The event revolved around the theme "The Future of Technology: Shaping Africa's Digital Future" and offered a diverse range of speakers, panels, workshops, and exhibits, showcasing the latest innovations in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things.
  
  As event attendees, we seized the opportunity to explore the extensive range of exhibitor stands and engage with influential figures in the industry. Although we were unable to participate as exhibitors due to the substantial costs involved, which ranged from $5,000 to $70,000, we made the most of our presence by introducing Decred to various exhibitors and articulating our activities and mission. Through the badge scanning system employed at each stand, exhibitors could access information about us, enabling us to initiate conversations and network effectively. It was truly gratifying to exchange ideas and establish connections with individuals representing diverse backgrounds. While many exhibitors were unfamiliar with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, we also encountered individuals who possessed prior knowledge in these domains. Notably, we established a valuable contact with IR4LAB, a Saudi Arabian company specializing in Blockchain solutions. Moreover, we came across a certified Blockchain course offered by the Blockchain Council, priced at $800.
  
  Looking ahead, we hope that Decred will seize the opportunity to exhibit at one of the largest tech events in the future. Participation in such an event would significantly enhance our outreach efforts, foster valuable partnerships within the industry, and contribute to the growth and development of Decred.

  Our experience at the GITEX Africa Digital Summit was remarkable, providing us with valuable connections and knowledge. We express our gratitude for the opportunities presented during this event and look forward to other events.
