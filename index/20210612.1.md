### Blockchain governance: Decred Example

- start UTC: 2021-06-12 15:00
- end UTC: 2021-06-12 15:30
- presenters: arij

In this session, I talked about what is blockchain governance and why we need it, on-chain and off-chain governance, and examples of both types of governance in Decred.

Due to the lack of time I couldn't get the audience questions, but I got one message via the app asking about the layers of blockchain governance.
