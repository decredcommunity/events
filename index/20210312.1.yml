  - 7 teams presented final projects at the end of the hackathon of which 2 had a focus on how to make cryptocurrencies useful as new payment methods in touristic areas of Nayarit.
description: Decred in Spanish sponsored the Hackathon Nayarit 2021, organised by the Ministry of Education of Nayarit. Decred in Spanish also gave a Blockchain Education training week consisting of 5 webinars from March 1-5 prior to the hackathon on March 12-14.
notes:
  - $1,000 prize pool sponsored by Decred Latam that was divided as follows. $500 for the first prize, $300 second and $200 divided among the rest of the 20 participants that presented final projects. After the hackathon a learning session was made for winners to learn to use Decrediton, decred mobile wallets and a general overview on how to store and use cryptocurrencies. This session lasted for 3 hours and was very instructional as winners had a change to make questions while receiving their prizes.
