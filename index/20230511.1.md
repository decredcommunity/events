EMEC EXPO is an event dedicated to digital transformation, encompassing areas such as e-marketing, e-commerce, hosting and cloud services, mobile internet, social networks, the Internet of Things, and technology. This year, the 3rd edition of EMEC EXPO was held jointly with Big Data and AI, providing an even broader platform for exploring the latest advancements in these fields.

During the event, we had a stand that attracted a diverse range of visitors. Among the attendees were students, professionals from various industries, entrepreneurs, and professors, which created a dynamic environment for knowledge exchange and networking. Our participation proved to be a success, as we received a significant number of visitors who showed interest in Decred and its activities.

At our stand, we engaged with the visitors, providing them with brief explanations about Decred and its key features. We had the opportunity to meet individuals who were already familiar with our project, and we appreciated their support and enthusiasm. Additionally, we encountered individuals who were hearing about Decred for the first time, allowing us to introduce them to the concept and highlight its potential benefits.

One notable aspect of our participation was our interaction with several Moroccan companies. They expressed curiosity about how they could leverage Decred's blockchain within their organizations. We had fruitful discussions, sharing insights into blockchain technology and explaining potential use cases that could benefit their companies.

We appreciate the opportunity to attend the EMEC EXPO and the Big Data and AI events. Positive feedback, visitor interest, and engagement with Moroccan businesses have strengthened our dedication to promoting Decred technology and its features.

As we reflect on our successful participation, we anticipate further opportunities to showcase Decred, collaborate with industry leaders, and advance digital transformation in Morocco and beyond.
