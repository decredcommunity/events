notes:
  - Contact with the U. de El Salvador was initiated since it is the largest college in El Salvador.
  - This was an internal event of the U. de El Salvador planned with the coordinator of the economics faculty, originally was to be held in August, but moved to this date upon university request.
  - There was no public announcement, invitation was made by professors to students only.
  - The talk was scheduled for two hours but extended by another hour for Q&A.
