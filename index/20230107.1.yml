  Google Developer Group of Settat and Women Techmakers Settat-Marrakech has held an event "DevFest Settat-Marrakesh 2022", one of the biggest events of IT in Morocco, at the Faculty of Science and Technology of Settat.
 
  I was invited to talk about the Power of Blockchain and presented the Decred example.
 
  The majority of the attendees were developers and computer science students, there was a confusion about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I talked about the importance of using its own wallet and not the CEX.
 
  There was a lot of questions about how to work for Decred and doing internships. I was given 30 minutes but the talk took more as the audience was interested to know more.
 
  And it was an opportunity for me to attend other speeches and to learn new things.
