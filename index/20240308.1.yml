  **Event Overview**

  On the occasion of International Women's Day, I had the honor of participating as a speaker in a panel at an event titled "Girlz for Impact: Empowering Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Breaking Barriers in Tech," organized by Digigirlz ENSA Berrechid in collaboration with Enactus and ADEI clubs of ENSA Berrechid, as the Community Manager for Decred. The aim of this event was to foster discussions on leadership, entrepreneurship, and technological breakthroughs. The event provided a vital platform for sharing knowledge and experiences related to these crucial areas.

  **Attendance and Atmosphere**

  The event was marked by a significant turnout, attracting over 100 attendees, all of whom were engineering students at ENSA Berrechid. The atmosphere was charged with enthusiasm and a shared commitment to addressing the challenges and opportunities for women in technology and leadership.

  **Organizers and Speakers**

  I was honored to participate in the second panel discussion, which was about women in tech and breaking barriers. My presentation highlighted my journey with Decred, shedding light on DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and my experiences working as a contractor for Decred. The insights shared were aimed at inspiring and educating the attendees about the possibilities and challenges of working in the blockchain and crypto industry, particularly in innovative and decentralized environments. Many questions arose regarding the pathways for computer science students into blockchain and fintech, including queries about necessary experience and internship opportunities.

  **Decred's Presence and Impact**

  As a representative of Decred, my participation in the event was geared towards fostering understanding and interest in decentralized technologies and their potential to transform traditional work paradigms. By sharing my experiences and the work of Decred, the aim was to encourage more women to explore opportunities in blockchain technology and consider careers in decentralized organizations.

  **Conclusion**

  "Girlz for Impact" at ENSA Berrechid was a landmark event that not only celebrated International Women's Day but also served as a catalyst for dialogue and inspiration among future female leaders in tech. The collaboration between Digigirlz, Enactus, and ADEI clubs at ENSA Berrechid played a crucial role in making this event a success, providing a supportive and enlightening environment for students to learn and grow. As Decred's Community Manager, the opportunity to share insights and experiences with aspiring women in tech was immensely rewarding, further solidifying Decred's commitment to inclusivity and empowerment in the technology sector.
