The Junior Chamber International of Morocco is the first branch of JCI in Africa and the Arab world. Its mission is to contribute to the progress of the national community by offering young Moroccans the opportunity to develop their leadership talents, social responsibility, the entrepreneurial spirit, and the solidarity necessary to create positive change.

We have signed a partnership with JCI to provide training to young members of this institute and companies concerning Blockchain technology and Decred technology.
