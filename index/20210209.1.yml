description: I was invited to introduce Decred features and roadmap to their public. We talked to the new people in this space, showed all Decred products and insights about the potential of each one, like private money, DEX, LN, atomic swaps, DAO+Treasury, etc. The general public liked it very much and was trying to figure out more about the project. The price was at $94.
