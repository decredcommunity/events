description: I was invited to introduce Decred features and roadmap for their public. We speak to new people in this space, we showed all Decred products and insight about the individual potential of each one, like private money, DEX, LN, Atomic swaps, DAO+Treasury, etc. The general public liked it very much and was trying to figure out more about the project, the price was at $94.
