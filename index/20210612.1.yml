description:
  In this session, I've talked about Blockchain Governance what is it and why we need it, On-chain and Off-Chain governance, and I give an example of Decred governance and how it employs on-chain and off-chain governance.
  
  Due to the lack of time I couldn't get the audience questions, but I got one on the app by message asking about the layers of Blockchain Governance.
