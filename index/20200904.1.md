On this episode of Hablemos Decred we talked about timestamps with Jose Zarate from stamping.io. We discussed what is a timestamp, what are the use cases, what is Stamping doing with timestamps in Perú, how does dcrtime work and who is using it as a software solution for notarization of documents. The main questions from the audience were how can timestamps be used in government for transparency and what is the legal status of timestamps.
