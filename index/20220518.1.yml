  EMEC EXPO is a two-day event dedicated to the company's digital transformation, axed on e-marketing, e-commerce, hosting & cloud, mobile internet, social networks, and digital signage.

  The event is based on the concept of a fair/congress and brings together entrepreneurs and decision-makers of the digital world who come to share, during two days, the innovations, the latest trends, their knowledge, and their experience feedback at conferences, workshops, and keynotes.

  During these two days, we had the opportunity to represent Decred technology and meet new people from the technology field by exhibiting in a booth. We had many questions about how Decred works and the areas of use of its technology.

  We got new contacts and invitations to participate in events in the next few days.
