Decred Group has inked a collaboration with Casablanca's National Institute of Innovation and Advanced Technology (NIIT).Â This partnership is anchored in the shared vision of fostering community empowerment and propelling technological innovation.

Abdellatif Belmkadem, the president of NIIT, and Arij, Decred Group Community Manager in Region MENA, showcased the mutual aspirations of both entities. The established agreement, set for an initial duration of one year with potential renewal, emphasizes cooperative efforts in training, mentoring, and technological innovation. This synergy will be realized through a series of workshops, study sessions, and various interactive events.

One of the focal points of the partnership event was the introduction of "Islah.city." This platform, tailor-made for the inhabitants of Casablanca, offers a space for citizens to identify and collaboratively resolve urban challenges. The potential to integrate blockchain technology and timestamping, further enhancing its features, was a standout topic of discussion.
