  Within the framework of public policies for the economic and social inclusion of youth and digital transformation, Decred was present to train and show the technological evolution by showing the different benefits of blockchain, which was the most interesting topic of the event.

At a recent event, Decred played a big part in promoting the economic and social inclusion of young people as well as digital transformation. Over the course of two days on March 11th and March 22nd, we demonstrated the power of blockchain technology and its benefits to the attendees.

The Decred  Arabia team held an informative training session, highlighting the benefits of blockchain in the modern world. This made blockchain the most interesting topic of the event.

The Decred Arabia team demonstrated how blockchain can revolutionize the way businesses operate and promote greater economic and social inclusion. The features of Decred were shown as an example of what businesses and individuals can do with blockchain.

There were a closing ceremony at the end of the event.
