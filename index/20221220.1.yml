  The Junior Chamber International of Morocco is the first branch of JCI in Africa and the Arab world. Its mission is to contribute to the progress of the national community by offering young Moroccans the opportunity to develop their leadership talents, social responsibility, the entrepreneurial spirit, and the solidarity necessary to create positive change.
  
  As the MENA community manager for Decred Group, I was asked to speak on a panel hosted by JCI Casablanca.

  The discussion centered on five main points:

  The primary motivation for the first axis was to talk about my experience working for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The first step was to educate everyone on what a DAO is and how it operates. Most of the attendees in the room had never heard of this type of organization before, so they were eager to know about it and if one might be established in Morocco.

  Second, the experience of women in the IT industry was the focus of the second axis. Specifically, I spoke highly of the Decred Community, where I have found a welcoming and helpful group of people who are always there to lend a hand whenever I need one.

  The third axis was about the difficulties I encountered in form of finance, organization, and challenges, particularly during the COVID quarantine. I talked about how  we shifted into virtual events and educational videos, and I discussed the crypto market's volatility and the importance of learning to properly manage one's financial resources.

  The fourth concerned my future in both my personal and professional life.

  The fifth and final one focused on sharing stories and lessons learned for the benefit of women who want to work in or start a business in the IT industry.

  It was a great experience talking on a panel and sharing my experience working with Decred, I had a lot of positive feedback from the audience and the organizers.

  At the end of the event I received a trophee as a woman entrepreneur with the other panelists
