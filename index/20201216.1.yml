description: Since FOSS has existed, volunteer work has always been an option to develop professionally, gain experience and enter the industry of interest. Today, this model has left a legacy and makes it possible to work in the blockchain industry and be rewarded for it. There are new little explored professional lines that are consolidating as an attractive offer for new professionals. This talk expands on the subject and introduces the Decred DAO.
notes:
  - LAM_UAMX is a lab created with the purpose of spreading digital culture. Attendees were students of UAM-X (UAM Xochimilco) interested in learning about decentralized organizations.
