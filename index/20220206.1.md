Happy Birthday, #Decred 🥳🥳🎊🎉🎉🎊🎊

On the occasion of the 6th birthday of Decred, we had a great time celebrating this occasion with cake and music.

Besides the Decred Arabia community, there were representatives of the RNI party, and after the speech of Decred achievements over the last six years, representatives of RNI gave a short thank you speech to the Decred Group, and the party began with music, and everyone enjoyed the cake and pastries.

The event was held at Carré d'Or Casablanca in a big event room, we had to organize the event room in the morning (light shows, sound equipment, chairs and tables) before the arrival of guests in the afternoon.
