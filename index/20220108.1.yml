  RNI Ain Choq invited me to teach a course on blockchain technology and how it works.

  RNI stands for "Rassemblement National des Indépendants" in French, which can be translated as "National Gathering of Independents Party", which is a Moroccan political party.

  I had adequate time to explain blockchain technology and Decred technology and how it works because it was a two-day event. I used the Decred wallet (Decrediton) as an example and discussed how it works and how transactions work.

  The majority of those present were interested in cryptocurrencies; there were many traders, but most of them had no idea how things worked, and they were particularly interested in Decred staking, which I had to explain in detail so that they could do it themselves in the future.

  I gave my presentation in person on the first day (Jan-08 16:00-19:00 +0100). On the second day (Jan-15 16:00-19:00 +0100), I caught Covid and was forced to make it online.
