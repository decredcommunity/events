RNI Ain Choq invited me to teach a course on Blockchain technology and how it works.

I had adequate time to explain blockchain technology and Decred technology and how it works because it was a two-day event. I used the Decred wallet as an example and discussed how it works and how transactions work.

The majority of those present were interested in cryptocurrencies; there were many traders, but most of them had no idea how things worked, and they were particularly interested in Decred staking, which I had to explain in detail so that they could do it themselves in the future.
