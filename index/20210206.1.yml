On the occasion of Decred's anniversary, we had a great time presenting Decred and blockchain technology under the theme "New Technologies to promote the positive development of young people: Blockchain IA and Big Data"

There were three interventions: The first one was by Abderrahmane JAIZE a data scientist who talked about IA and machine learning, the second one was by Imane GANNAOUI who talked about Big Data and the last one was by me I talked about blockchain technology, what is it how it works and how it is used and I gived examples of the usage of Decred blockchain in brazil voting and the use case of blockchain in medicine and education.
