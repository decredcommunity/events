  On the occasion of Decred's 5th anniversary, we had a great time presenting Decred and blockchain technology under the theme "New technologies to promote the positive development of young people: Blockchain AI and Big Data".

  There were three talks. The first one was by Abderrahmane Jaize, a data scientist who talked about AI and machine learning. The second one was by Imane Gannaoui who talked about Big Data. The last one was by me and I talked about blockchain technology, how it works and how it is used. I gave examples of how Decred blockchain was used in Brazil elections and use cases of blockchain in medicine and education.

  At the end of the event there was a little ceremony celebrating Decred's fifth anniversary.
