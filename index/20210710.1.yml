      I was invited to animate a talk about Blockchain Technology at the hackathon.

      In my speech I talked about blockchains and gave some examples with Decred wallet and Politeia system. I had questions about blockchain, how they can use it to develop applications, and how they can work in blockchain projects, so I explained how I work in Decred to gave them an idea of joining.

      The presence was about 30 in YouCode Youssoufia and 25 in Safi.

  Computer science school named YouCode at Youssoufia (Morocco) organized a hackathon by the name "YOUCATHON: Youth For Change & Action (100 % Digital)". It was organized internally, that's why they didn't publish it online. It was held between two campuses, [YouCode Youssoufia](https://youcode.ma/Youssoufia) and [YouCode Safi](https://youcode.ma/Safi), who joined virtually.

  Five teams from each campus presented their projects about developing apps in different fields (healthcare, education, social, environment). Each group was composed of a UI/UX designer, a project manager, a backend developer, and a frontend developer.

  The event started at 9:00 AM and continued for 12 hours.
