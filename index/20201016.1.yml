  - there was no explicit Decred talk or presentation, it was more of a "cross-marketing" for Decred. Decred Latam streamed the panel on their YouTube channel and got several mentions during the event.
  - originally this was planned as HablemosDecred with Gus Grillasca, but he asked if we want to livestream the event as he was one of the speakers
