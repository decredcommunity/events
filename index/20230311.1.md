Decred was a key participant in an event that focused on promoting economic and social inclusion for youth through digital transformation.

During the two-day event, held on March 11th and March 22nd, we showcased the benefits of blockchain technology, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and promote greater economic and social inclusion.

In our informative training session and demo of Decred's features, we showed how Decrediton and staking work and talked about our PoW/PoS system and our system of reward.

Most of the attendees were young and interested in new technology, cryptocurrencies, and trading. We've got questions about Decred's blockchain, including whether it has its own blockchain or is built on another blockchain, what solutions Decred brings to the cryptocurrency industry, and whether the blockchain can be used for purposes other than crypto (we gave the example of Brazil's elections and timestamping). There were other questions about the fact that crypto is still illegal in Morocco, so how can they use it? We explained DCRDEX, peer-to-peer trading, and privacy features.

Following the event, we gained more followers on LinkedIn, which highlights the importance of exploring more social media platforms.

There were a closing ceremony at the end of the event.
