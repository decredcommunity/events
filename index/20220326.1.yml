  AEFDS Deroua (education, training and social development association) invited me to talk about Blockchain Technology and Decred Technology at the half-day training organized for their members.
  
  It was an excellent opportunity to initiate youth university people to blockchain technology and the Decred project. During my intervention, there have been many questions, especially about how transactions and the staking system work.

  The event was exclusive to AEFDS members only.
