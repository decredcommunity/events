  AEFDS Deroua invited me to talk about Blockchain Technology and Decred Technology at the half-day training organized for their members.
  
  It was an excellent opportunity to initiate youth university people to Blockchain technology and the Decred project. During my intervention, there have been many people, especially about how transactions work and the staking system.

  The event was exclusive to AEFDS members only.
