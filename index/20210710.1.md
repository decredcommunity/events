Computer science school named YouCode at Youssoufia (Morocco) organized a hackathon by the name "YOUCATHON: Youth For Change & Action (100 % Digital)". It was organized internally, that's why they didn't announce or publish it online. It was held between two campuses, [YouCode Youssoufia](https://youcode.ma/Youssoufia) and [YouCode Safi](https://youcode.ma/Safi), who joined virtually.

Five teams from each campus presented their projects about developing apps in different fields (healthcare, education, social, environment). Each group was composed of a UI/UX designer, a project manager, a backend developer, and a frontend developer.

The event started at 09:00 (UTC+1) and continued for 12 hours.

Attendance:

- 55 (30 in YouCode Youssoufia and 25 in Safi)

I was invited to animate a talk about blockchain technology at the hackathon.

In my speech I talked about blockchains and gave some examples with Decred wallet and Politeia system. I got questions about blockchain, how they can use it to develop applications, and how they can work in blockchain projects, so I explained how I work in Decred to give them an idea of joining.
