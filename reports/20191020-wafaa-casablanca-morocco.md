## Overview

(shared in chat on [2019-10-20](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$157159415718215tdXiN:decred.org))

I was asked by the Wafaa Association to talk about blockchains after they helped to run the [meetup](20190921-decred-meetup-casablanca-morocco.md) in Casablanca on Sep 21.

There were about 20 people that attended the event, they were mostly students from universities.

I started the presentation talking about blockchain fundamentals, and then I talked about the consensus system and how it works, the presentation took us two hours from 10 to 12 am.

The attendees were very interested in the blockchain technology as they heard about it for the first time, and we were asked if we could do another presentation cause they wanted to know more.
