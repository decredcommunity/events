## Overview

BlueYard has been accumulating DCR since early 2018. They wrote [this excellent thesis](https://medium.com/@BlueYard/decred-82b284b4a795) to explain why. As an investor and supporter of the project, they organized this event in collaboration with the Decred community. BlueYard also organized a similar Decred event [in July 2018](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/decred-x-blueyard-berlin-meetup-currencies-core-chains-the-future-of-blockchain-governance-and-tickets-47586593783). 

The aim of the meetup was to bring together Decred community members, as well as attract cypto / blockchain enthusiasts from Berlin to investigate the Decred project. Berlin has an active crypto community, as demonstrated by [this](https://www.fullnode.berlin/mission/) co-working space and frequent blockchain events in the city. One day before the event, some of us had dinner with BlueYard. On the day itself, a small group gathered to have lunch (lupper) while wearing our Decred T-shirts. After the event we went to have drinks in the city (of course still wearing our Decred shirts). This helped to build a strong sense of community.

## Event description

We arrived about 30 minutes before the event started. The people from BlueYard helped @jholdstock set up his laptop for the presentation. Based on the reservations we expected around 50 people, but due to excellent weather (it was a warm and sunny evening) only half of them actually showed up at the venue.

The presentation by @jholdstock was a detailed overview of the project: why it was created, how it works, what has been achieved, and what will come in the future. After the talk he received some sharp questions by the audience, which inspired a public discussion that carried on even after the official program ended.

## Reflection

From artists to Bitcoin developers to Golang enthusiasts, the audience was very diverse. Most attendees were aware of what was going on in the blockchain / crypto space. Berlin is definitely an area we could hold more frequent Decred meetups.

Next time we could plan the event around another noteworthy event / conference, to attract even more newcomers.

Next time we could engage the people who sign up, perhaps a day before the event, to increase the attendance rate.

Reflection from @karamble:

> I got the feeling instead of having these extended introduction to decred presentations giving just 10 minute stripped intros and after that showcasing what has been checked on the roadmap during the last months (...). people want to practice or see demos. they ask for showcases of politeia and the wallets. it should be standard to have one guy during the face2face 'bar and pizza' discussions that can demonstrate stuff on a laptop/mobile. berlin attracts developers.

## Media

#### News coverage:

We did not promote this event heavily, so no noteworthy news coverage.
