## Overview

With the release of the new privacy features, Decred contributors were asked to organize local meetups and spread the news. Amsterdam has an active crypto community, so I decided to join forces with an existing meetup that organizes blockchain events and co-working days. The event venue was located very close to the central station so people from different cities could attend as well.

## Event description

The aim of the presentation was to give an overview of the existing privacy projects, introduce Decred's approach to privacy, as well as connect with the wider crypto community in the Netherlands. When I arrived to the venue it was already filled with people. Because this was my first talk about privacy I wanted to go through the slides one more time instead of mingling with the crypto crowd. The talk started at 15:00 and it took about 40 minutes to present, although I answered some questions during the presentation as well. After the talk we had a lively group discussion that lasted for more than an hour. Even when people started leaving I had great conversations with those who remained.

## Reflection

It was great to reconnect with the Dutch crypto community. There is a lot of interest in what Decred is doing and I'm positive we can organize a larger meetup in the near future. Next time I would also love to include a demo of the (testnet) wallet. It would also be great to let people download the testnet app and give them free drinks in exchange for testnet DCR.
