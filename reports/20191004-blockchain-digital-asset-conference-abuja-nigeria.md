## Reflection

It was a lot of interesting experiences. The experience was worth while. Most people got to know about Decred for the first time. Most of the people at the conference were investors, speculators and dignitaries who graced the occasion with their presence.

Former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria Prof. Kingsley Moghalu gave a talk titled "Blockchain-based System, Immediate Benefits and Long-term Transformational Potential for Africa". Many investors were interested in Decred right after learning about it. We were also the only global cryptocurrency there, and having a high CoinMarketCap rating got attendees blown away.

We got to have one on one session with attendees where they asked questions about SPV, Lightning Network and our DEX system. We also gave them postcards for a follow up. We also got a confirmation from [Kudi Exchange](https://kudi.exchange) for listing our coin on their platform in December/January.

In summmary, most people were suprised about the growth of Decred and CoinMarketCap listing.

Ideas for improvement:

- A large screen display for a better presentation to attendees who come to our stand.
- Better sticker designs, probably also add stakey icon as stickers.
