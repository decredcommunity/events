## Overview

Jalisco Talent Land is the biggest technology event in the country with a focus on cultivating and headhunting talent from students that are about to finish their BA studies in computer science, business and entrepreneurship areas. For the past years, Talent Land has become the most important tech event in Mexico and this year they gather almost double attendees than last year, around 60,000. Overall the experience was fulfilling because we were the only major cryptocurrency in "Blockchain Land", had dedicated area of the expo, and were the only decentralised autonomous entity that participated. This gave us the opportunity to position Decred as one of the leaders in the cryptocurrency industry with growing presence in Mexico and LATAM.

Decred presented a talk "Decred: el dinero del futuro" with a turn-out of around 35 people. The talk was a high level overview of Decred's characteristics and why it is designed to last for generations. The presentation also showcased Decrediton, Politeia as a tool for decision making, the challenges of blockchain governance, an important case for the contractor model and how the Treasury provides continuous funding for the development of the project. The questions of the public were about the origins of Decred, the process of staking DCR, the role of the Treasury in allowing the project to grow without external influence and the contractor model.

In terms of networking Jalisco Talent Land was a good opportunity to connect with high level contacts from the industry. Among them we got the chance to talk with Christy Choi, director of Finance Labs, Luis Quilo, community manager Binance Latam, partners from Adaptive Capital, Jose Rodriguez, VP of Bitso Exchange, Lorena and David, owners of the Bitcoin Embassy Mexico, David Yao director of Blockchain Land at Talent Land, Ernesto Contreras, community manager Dash Latam, Issac Philips, Siglo, Abraham Cobos from Naos Blockchain Capital, Omar Zaragoza from Kapytal exchange, Jamal Zyat from Singularity University, just to name a few.

Decred booth at Blockchain Land was a tremendous success, the team spoke with hundreds of young students that were eager to know more about the project. Some of the ideas that resonated the most among them were "digital scarce money", "be your own bank", "global money" and "descentralization". The idea of being your own bank is really catchy among the generation in their early 20s and is amazing to talk to them about cryptocurrencies because they get it right away, it just makes sense for them to transit from coins to paper to plastic cards to smartphones, they completely get it.

Another idea that resonated a lot among young developers was the fact that Decred could be seen as a factory of free software with a mechanism to self-sustain the development. Many devs were curious and surprised to know that Decred could make FOSS thanks to the treasury of the project without the interference of for-profit schemes of venture capital. Most students and devs were fascinated with the fact that we have a self-sustainable source of funds that allows to pay for everything related to the development of the project.

As the ecosystem in Mexico and Latin America grows in numbers, the presence of Decred at Talent Land was an excellent opportunity to build brand recognition in a region where adoption rates and use cases are set to explode in the following years. We set the objective of presenting Decred as one of the leading players in the cryptocurrency and decentralised software industry and I would definitely recommend to continue our presence in Talent Land for the next edition in 2020.

Details to improve: more flyers dedicated to write word passphrase and pencils, more business cards, additional content in Spanish through social media.
