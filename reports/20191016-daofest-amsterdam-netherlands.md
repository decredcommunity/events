## Overview

This was the first DAOfest in the Netherlands. It was organized as an official side-event of the [Hard Fork Summit](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork-summit). The [original DAOfest](https://www.daofest.io/) was organized in Berlin as part of the Berlin Blockchain Week. Initially I wasn't planning to go since you needed a (paid) conference pass to get in. However, the day before the DAOfest took place the event organizers invited me to participate on a panel, so I decided to join and spread the word about the Decred DAO.

## Event description

The first thing I noticed: the event was very well organized. The venue was top-notch and the audience was "in the know" about crypto and DAOs. I arrived during the introduction by Luuk Weber, the event-organizer, as he gave an overview of DAOs and DAOstack. The first presentation was by @evok3d and he talked about his experiences in Mexico, as well as Decred's governance model (on-chain consensus votes and Politeia proposals) and Decred's new privacy features. The second talk was about "continuous funding" but this seemed not too relevant for Decred. The final part of the meetup was a fireside chat without fireside that had @evok3d, Samuel Gosling (Validity) and myself on the panel. It was a discussion about the fundamentals of DAOs, the opportunities, challenges, and whether DAOs will one day reach mainstream adoption. After the main program ended there was plenty of time for networking and drinks.

## Reflection

It was great to experience the professionalism of the Dutch crypto community. It was also great to have drinks with like-minded people and talk about all things crypto. Apart from reconnecting with familiar faces I also connected with new people who were interested in Decred. I even met a Go developer who was familiar with btcd! We exchanged LinkedIn contacts, hopefully he will be able to contribute to dcrd one day. I also met someone from the Decred_NL Telegram group. There is definitely a growing interest Decred.
