## Reflection

People got to know about Decred.

Most of people at the conference were investors and speculators.

At the conference, most of them got to know about Decred for the first time. Many investors are interested in Decred right after learning about it and its projects.

Over 40 people were reached and learned about Decred one by one. Some people grabbed Decred handouts by themselves and initiatively got back to ask for more details. 

* About over 30 trifolds, 25 - 30 postcards each types, 10 stickers were gave away to people one by one.
* 10 trifolds, 30 postcards, 30 stickers were grabbed by people themselves.

One miner asked a lot about Decred and was looking to research more. As he said he would think about creating a miner team in Singapore to mine Decred. 

A Vietnamese investor, lead of an investor group in Vietnam, said he would like to have a meeting with Decred representative in Hanoi to ask more about DCR and he found DCR has potential to be invested in. His contact was added into Decred Vietnam telegram group. We can get back to him via telegram. 

There are 2 upcoming events in Vietnam that Indonesian investors will come, one of them is Vietnam Blockchain Confex (Jan 2020).

Ideas for improvement:

- Put Decred's short name (DCR) into trifolds and postcards. Many people asked what Decred's short name is.

- Trifold and postcards should be redesigned to have better looks such as:

* There are too many words and wall of texts in Trifolds that make it too much to read and the size of texts is too small. 
* There are 3 different postcards that seems making people confusing while receiving and reading it.
* Adding QR code into the handouts.

- Hold a meeting in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh city for people who learned about Decred to get more detail information and keep interested in investing in Decred. Since there are so many coins and tokens are launched, if we do not keep getting Decred to people who  already knew it.
