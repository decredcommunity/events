## Reflection

People get to know about Decred.

Most people at the conference were investors and projectors.

In the conference, most of them get to know about Decred for the first time. Many investors are interested in Decred right after knowing about it and its projects.

One miner asked a lot about Decred and was looking to research more.

A Vietnamese investor, lead of an investor group in Vietnam, said he would like to have a meeting with Decred representative in Hanoi to ask more about DCR and he found DCR has potential to be invested in.

Information gets from the conference:

There are 2 upcoming events in Vietnam that Indonesian investors will come:

- Vietnam Blockchain Confex (Jan 2020)

Ideas for improvement:

- Put Decred's short name (DCR) into trifolds and postcards. Many people asked what Decred's short name is.
