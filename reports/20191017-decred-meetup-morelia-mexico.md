## Goals

- Introduce Decred Project, as an innovative and inclusive project to develop the economy in Mexico and LATAM.
- Teach about a blockchain government model very different from the current political system of a traditional economy.
- Motivate them to learn programming applied to blockchain.
- Motivate economics students to study blockchain for payment methods and implications.

## Evaluation

- To be the first talk about blockchain, it had a lot of interest from students and teachers. We had a total of 250 enrolled in eventbrite, an asistencia of a little over 100. It was really an estimate of spectators, since although we had registration in eventbritte the event was freely accessible, then in reality it was more than 100 people, not counting those who entered and left.
- The presentation of @francov_ on blockchain and digital economy was very good, she did not use blockchain technicalities that at the time could be difficult to understand by a person who knows nothing or has barely heard about blockchain and bitcoin.
- Also the presentation of @luisantoniocrag_ about an introduction to decredproject was very good. they understood the basics and asked a lot. What really caught their attention was the degree of decentralization where to work together it doesn't matter university degrees, age, nationality or anything else to be able to work and do great things.
- The event aroused interest so much, that they asked about what programming language is better for developing a blockchain (obviously Go haha). We also had questions about what we thought about the creation of a blockchain agency and things like that ...
- Then they invited us to a very important state entrepreneurship event, that same night to talk about blockchain and tell the public.
- In short, the event fully met expectations.

After the meetup, Univesity invited us to the talent nights (the most important entrepreneurship event in this state) to talk with entrepreneurs about Decred and blockchain.

## Learnings & Outcomes

1. Make more content visual like animations. People placed a higher level of interest in that type of media.
2. Having a bigger SWAG, they loved Decred t-shirts (they almost fought over them).
3. Have a more efficient mechanism to get more followers in our social networks. In the event we only obtained about +25 followers in total.
