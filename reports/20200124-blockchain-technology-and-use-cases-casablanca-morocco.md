## Overview

I was invited to talk at an event held by "Toratiyat Dar Albayda" that was about "The role of new technologies in promoting the positive development of young people". I chose to talk about "Blockchain Technology and Use Cases".

I've started the presentation by talking about blockchain technology, explored the different uses cases of it and introduced Politeia and the Lightning Network as examples of Decred technology.

The event started at 16:30 and I had the opportunity to talk at about 17:00 and it took about 35 minutes to present and another 20 minutes to answer the audience questions. After the presentations we had a lively group discussion that lasted for more than an hour so we finished at 19:00.

The audience really liked the subject and wanted to know more and we were asked if we could do a series of workshops about blockchain technology.
