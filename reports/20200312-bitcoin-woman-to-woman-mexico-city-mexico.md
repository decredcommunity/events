## Overview

It was an invitation from the Bitcoin Embassy Bar to give a talk about Decred as a female participant and about my experience with more women in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

There was an opportunity to discuss and exchange opinions about the advantages of labor inclusion in the new technological organizations.

The highlight of the talk was to express that we do not need your title, gender, nationality, age, even your real name, we only need your talent and your aspiration to help the Decred ecosystem grow.

We also talked with the public to resolve doubts and concerns about the project. Mainly about the governance system and where do development funds come from.

## Goals

- Explain how the collaboration of Decred contractors is for new applicants.
- Dispel doubts about roles as contractors.

## Evaluation

- The talk lasted 10 minutes, I explained it in a clear and understandable way, with good audience interaction.

## Learnings & Outcomes

- Interest in participating in projects like Decred
