## Overview

With hundreds of members in the Decred Chinese Wechat groups, China is one of the largest Decred communities. The most frequent feedback we have been receiving is the lack of marketing in China, so @Dominic, @guang and I (@changhugo) thought about organizing a meetup in China to introduce Decred to more people. I spoke with a couple of community members in NYC during the Blockchain Week, including @Dustorf, @jz, Leo, Guo, and Yulong, and we came to a consensus that we should go ahead with the event. We chose Beijing as the city to host our first meetup because Beijing is home to many blockchain companies and the location is convenient to both @Dominic and @changhugo.

We decided to contact [BlockBeats](https://www.theblockbeats.com/) to co-host the meetup because we wanted the event to be big enough so that it can initiate other marketing activities and introduce Decred to people outside the Decred community. BlockBeats is one of the most recognized crypto media outlets in China who are known for being selective on contents and projects to work with. We wanted to keep the number of attendance below 100 so that we don't need to register the event with the police.

## Event description

We invited two of the most influential crypto leaders in China, founder of F2Pool and founder of Poolin. @Dominic opened the event with a 30 min presentation on Decred, talking about governance, DEX, and DAO. The presentation was followed by a 30 min panel that discussed the future of crypto. Both of the mining pool founders shared valuable insights. After that, @changhugo made a 30 min presentation on the investment value of Decred, pitching Decred as a store of value and showing Decred as an undervalued investment. The last 30 min panel discussed current crypto investment opportunities, featuring the founder of BlockBeats, founder of Alternity Capital (Guo Chen, Decred community member) and VP of Bubi.

BlockBeats promoted the event to reach over 25,000 people. 200 people signed up for the event, and close to 100 actually showed up. While most of the participants don't hold any DCR, everyone is familiar with blockchain. We had engaging discussions with event participants who are interested in Decred's governance and the PoW+PoS hybrid system. Participants are aware of Decred's strong technical background, and is different from many of the scammy local projects. A couple of local exchanges approached and asked if we are interested in listing DCR on their exchanges with a fee.

The video [livestream](https://m.yizhibo.com/l/3PmAb5dWGgMH7qme.html) of the event had over 4,000 views, and the photo [livestream](https://gallery.vphotos.cn/vphotosgallery/index.html?vphotowechatid=CF16F8ED9F4DF13E002D3CA0ADEA152C) had over 7,000 views. After the event, we have gained 50 followers on our Weibo account.

## Reflection

Crypto marketing is expensive in China, publishing a single article on any major crypto outlet costs more than $2,000. Money was well spent on the Beijing meetup. We paid $4,000 to BlockBeats for writing two Decred specific articles, covering the entire cost associated with the event (venue, photos, livestream, moderator), and leveraging BlockBeats' reputation to invite panelists and to attract audience who don't know about Decred. Through the event, we set up healthy relationships with many of the top mining pools and crypto media in China, including F2Pool, Poolin, Cobo, BlockBeats, Odaily, First.Vip, Tangent and Hoo. They each have thousands of followers and they could help us to spread important project news in the future. As a follow up, @Dominic will represent Decred to attend the [biggest staking conference](https://www.huodongxing.com/event/2496757517700) in China organized by BlockBeats and Odaily on 10 July 2019.

We chose to find a partner to co-host our first meetup because @Dominic and I are not familiar with Beijing and we have limited experience in hosting events, but we have gained enough experience and resources to host future events without a partner. The logical location for the next meetup is Hangzhou/Shanghai or Hong Kong/Shenzhen where a couple of our community members are based.

## Media

#### News coverage:

Our media partners (BlockBeats, Chainnode, First.Vip, Nodeasy and Hoo) promoted the meetup to their followers, and we probably reached the entire crypto space in China. Inviting the two mining pool founders helped a lot with news coverage. Founder of Poolin sent a [Weibo tweet](https://matrix.decred.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/decred.org/SrqeoeBfckZwgkyBcQVEzXkt) about a comment he made during the meetup, and his comment was broadcasted by multiple media. BlockBeats also wrote one [article](https://www.theblockbeats.com/news/1689) before the event to introduce Decread that reached at least 2,000 of their followers.
