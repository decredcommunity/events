## Overall experience

Decred organised a meetup in Bogota, Colombia, with the local support and co-hosting of Blockchain Academy Colombia, as part of their regular meetups on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They are one of the most well-known and respected startups in Colombia working to develop cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, they are supporting projects to get closer to the Colombian ecosystem and to educate on innovative technologies. The meetup was also co-hosted by Cointelegraph en Español and Panda Exchange.

We got the chance to present the project to the local community of entrepreneurs, developers and enthusiasts of Bogota. The presentation was a high level overview of the project main characteristics: its cypherpunk ethos, the hybrid blockchain PoW/PoS, Politeia, the contractor model and our plans for the future. Of particular interest for the devs in the audience was the integration of Lightning Network, Decred's devs involvement in the development of Atomic Swaps and the possibility of ticket splitting through the LN. The event was attended by about 40-50 people of all ages from 20 to 50, mainly crypto enthusiasts. Of them some 10 used to mine DCR back in the day with their GPUs.

The questions from the audience were very interesting and allowed for a deep conversation about Decred. Some of the best question were about the attack vectors to the decision making process of Decred, the role of PoS tickets on the validation of Decred's blockchain, what gives value to DCR and how is the social contract of Decred maintained. Other interesting questions were about the degree of decentralisation of Decred's DAO, how sustainable funding can allow open source projects to worry about coding instead of profiting, the role of ASICs, adoption plans in Latam and when DCR could be used to buy beer.

I was glad to have such level of questions as it reflects that the audience is aware of the many nuances of creating a global digital currency on the foundations of global, P2P, uncensorable, permissionless, self-governed Store of Value scarce digital asset.

As part of the meetup we [gave away](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1188496680133500934) 1 DCR to the local community through an activity in which attendees would have to like, RT and comment #DecredenColombia in order to participate in the random selection of a winner. This activity presented a high level of engagemnet from the audience.
