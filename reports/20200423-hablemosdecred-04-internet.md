## Overall experience

This time the HablemosDecred meetup was focused on exchanges and the DEX Decred is building. @elian started with a brief introduction to Decred and the cryptocurrency space, followed by an overview of the exchange landscape. @pablito went into the motives and reasons why Decred is building a distributed exchange and how it enables more people to access Decred while preserving their personal data.

There were much more attendants than usual, but we did not have much visual support or slides. Visual support seems more important than ever in virtual meetups to retain attention. Towards the end, people engaged and discussed about the DEX, how will it work and how other currencies could be supported.

## Lessons learnt

It is very difficult to create an atmosphere similar to regular meetups, where people just drink and talk. At the beginning, we encouraged people to introduce themselves in order to begin a much more horizontal discussion, but attendees seem more interested in hearing an "expert" while remaining muted. Many people might be doing something else while listening to the Jitsi call.

Virtual meetups might need to rethink SWAG and ways to reward active members, who make questions and participate.
