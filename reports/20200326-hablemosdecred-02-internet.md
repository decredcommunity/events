## Overall experience

The second #HablemosDecred virtual meetup was more like a regular meetup. We started the community call with two talks: @elian gave a whole intro to Decred, the 'Decred in 20' talk he usually includes in events, and @pablito showcased Decrediton, hands on connecting to Decred's Testnet to send some DCR, buy tickets and explain the wallet's core features.

Attendance remained the same, topping at 15, but different people joined the room. We began with a quick round of presentations, so to know each other, and went right into the planned talks. We encouraged people to interrupt us if they wanted to know more about each topic we covered and used up a whole hour. At the end, we did 20 minutes of QA, about any Decred-related topic.

## Moving to Jitsi

Moving to Jitsi was a good idea overall. Users don't have to download any software, just join the room by entering it's URL. Some web browsers worked better than others, some had problems with the audio and others with the screen sharing feature.

Browser compatibility (from best to worse):

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Brave
