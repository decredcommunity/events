# Reflection

People get to know about Decred:

People in the conference: most of them are investors and projectors. 

In the conference, most of them get to know about Decred for the first time. Many investors are interested in Decred right after knowing about Decred and DCR projects. 

There was a miner asked a lot about Decred. He will research more on DCR. 

A Vietnamese investor, a leader of an investor group in Vietnam, said he would like to have a meeting with DCR representative in Hanoi to ask more about DCR and he found DCR is potential to be invested in. 

Information gets from the conference:

There are 2 upcoming events in Vietnam that Indonesian investors will come:
Vietnam Blockchain conflex (Jan 2020)


Ideas to improve: 

Put Decred’s short name (DCR) into trifolds and postcards. Many people asked what DCR’s short name is.
