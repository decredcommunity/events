Hey team - eSizeDave and I had a wonderful time running a blockchain governance workshop at the Digital Innovation Festival's Blockchain Bootcamp

The participants consisted of lawyers from top law firms down in Australia, consultants from the big 4, academics and other interesting folk who are active in the ecosystem.

We've been invited by Ernst & Young to run a DCR specific presentation to start work on exploring how we may be of use to their clients in terms of prototyping some case studies.

A few other opportunities have come whereby we have been asked to present at some more locally run high-end distributed technology initiatives. All very cool and we will make sure to scope it out!

The presentation will be shared with everyone should you need content for your presentations on Blockchain Governance.

Expenses other than time: Zero.

The audience at our specific presentation consisted of:

- Academia
  - University of Melbourne Computer Science Department Professor (Blockchain)
  - RMIT University Social Sciences postgrad (working with Ellie Rennie at the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub)
  - Swinburne University of Technology postgrad (Enterprise Innovation and FinTech)

- Corporate/Business
  - EY/Ernst & Young
  - VC rep (I didn't get the name of the firm, but got his contact details since he's an old friend from way back I was surprised to see after a years of where-ya-been)
  - SAAVI (an Australian mobile ordering company) company seeking a governance model for their profit share model
  - Strategic Commercialisation Australia (an organisation focused on propping up advanced tech initiatives in Australia ensuring compliance, market entry, and commercialisation... yeah that's Australian spelling).

- Legal
  - Hall & Wilcox (a major law firm in Australia)
  - Agile Legal (Law firm focused on servicing tech and innovation initiatives)

- Government
  - The State Government of Victoria (Melbourne is the capital city of the state of Victoria, Australia. This Digital Innovation Festival is their event)

- NFP
  - Blockchain Global
  - Blockchain APAC

- General Public
  - Reps from other blockchain projects, investors, and tech companies.

The following have asked us to follow-up with them to present at their events and/or to collaborate:

- Blockchain APAC (unannounced event due to occur late October)
- Hall & Wilcox (they got wind competing law firms have asked us to work with them, so yeah, now they want in)
- EY (they sounded like they want us to help them with pretty much everything... LoL... well look not really, but a lot was discussed and at this point they want to meet with Zohand and I to flesh stuff out)

The aim of this presentation was to discuss blockchain governance in general, and of course I spent at least half of it on Decred, and quite frankly it's what they were interested in most. I'd better get my ass working on my special RancherOS implementation of a VSP, because they want demos of all this and Politeia.
