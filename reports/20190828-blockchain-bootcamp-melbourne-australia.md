## Overview

(originally shared in chat on [2019-08-28](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$156697235011245SxvJY:decred.org) and [2019-09-02](https://matrix.to/#/!aNPTuiryMFmdMQWUzb:decred.org/$156739040517633gdQNG:decred.org))

We've been invited by The Blockhain Centre as part of Digital Innovation Festival, an initiative by the State Government of Victoria.

The participants consisted of lawyers from top law firms down in Australia, consultants from the big 4, academics and other interesting folk who are active in the ecosystem.

A few other opportunities have come whereby we have been asked to present at some more locally run high-end distributed technology initiatives. All very cool and we will make sure to scope it out!

The audience at our specific presentation consisted of:

- Academia
  - University of Melbourne Computer Science Department Professor (Blockchain)
  - RMIT University Social Sciences postgrad (working with Ellie Rennie at the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub)
  - Swinburne University of Technology postgrad (Enterprise Innovation and FinTech)

- Corporate/Business
  - Ernst & Young (EY)
  - VC rep (got his contact details)
  - SAAVI (an Australian mobile ordering company, they're seeking a governance model for their profit sharing model)
  - Strategic Commercialisation Australia (an organisation focused on propping up advanced tech initiatives in Australia ensuring compliance, market entry, and commercialisation... yeah that's Australian spelling).

- Legal
  - Hall & Wilcox (a major law firm in Australia)
  - Agile Legal (Law firm focused on servicing tech and innovation initiatives)

- Government
  - The State Government of Victoria (Melbourne is the capital city of the state of Victoria, Australia. This Digital Innovation Festival is their event)

- NFP
  - Blockchain Global
  - Blockchain APAC

- General Public
  - Reps from other blockchain projects, investors, and tech companies.

The following have asked us to follow-up with them to present at their events and/or to collaborate:

- Blockchain APAC: unannounced event due to occur late October
- Hall & Wilcox: they got wind competing law firms have asked us to work with them, so yeah, now they want in
- EY: a lot was discussed and at this point they want to meet with us to flesh stuff out

The aim of this presentation was to discuss blockchain governance in general, and of course I (@eSizeDave) spent at least half of it on Decred, and quite frankly it's what they were interested in most.

There were no expenses other than time.
