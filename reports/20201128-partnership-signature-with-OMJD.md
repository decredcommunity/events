#### Overall experience

After the online meetup with "The Moroccan Organization of Young Decision Makers" that was held online on 08 July 2020, we've signed a partnership agreement with OMJD in order to work together in the technological field for the benefit of the youth.

The partnership agreement details that we will hold meetups, workshops and conferences about Decred and Blockchain technology for the benefit of the young.

The partnership agreement will go for two years.

There was a [press](youtu.be/2gI_RRdIJ5U) conference held at the end of the event.
