## Overview

Talent Land is the biggest technology event for students in Mexico and Decred has been an sponsor of the event for second year. Due to Covid19 this Talent Land posponed the IRL event and organised a virtual event during the week that was originally scheduled. The entire event was held in April 13-17, received more than 170,000 virtual attendees that assisted to over 50 presentations about blockchain, entrepreneurship, gaming, business, woman and software development. 

Decred team presented a panel on titled "The future of money and romote working". The objective of the panel was to explore the intersection between money, technology and remote working through the lens and experience of 4 contractors of the project in Latam. The shared their experience working remotely inbetween Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, the challenges that this implicate and the opportunities that also arise from this work dynimics. 

The team shared their experience using Decred as a global currency, the role of the contractor model to allow anyone to collaborate, how the project is completely autnomous and designed to continusly grow even in the most harsh conditons. It was  good opportunity to showcase what makes Decred unique and how the proyect is building some of the most innovative software developments in the cryptocurrency industry. 

## Goals

The first goal of the panel was to explore how Decred is innovating in several areas from digital money to remote working. We wanted to create a conversation that would grow the imagination of our audience by putting Decred at the center of innovative ideas for the XXI century like cryptocurrency, blockchain, digital money, decentralisation, remote working and the potential to live and work on the internet. 

We recognise that the audience of Talent Land is not going to become an stakeholder in the short term. But rather we see that this young segment of university students, mainly engeneer and software students, will be keen to subjects in which Decred is tremendously powerful. Moreover, we are keen to continue exploring conversations that will inspire youngsters to be the best they can be throught education and technology. We are certain that education is key for cryptocurrency adoption and putting the our expertise at the center of these conversations is paramount to build awareness around Decred Project.

## Learnings and Outcomes

The team received good comments on panel due to its relevance in the times of Covid19. And this is something that we wanted, to put the proyect at the center of a global discussion and how its innovative approach is setting good practices for other organisations to replicate. The panel was a good opportunity to set Decred in a biggesr conversation. There was also good feedback in relation to the moderation of the panel, the reponses and the fact that the team was representative of Mexico and Argentina.
