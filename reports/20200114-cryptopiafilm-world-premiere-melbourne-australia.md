## Overview

Decred was invited to be an event sponsor and launch partner of Cryptopia Film, a documentary about the key themes within cryptocurrency, which include regulation, privacy, financial services, governance, marketing and development.

The event was a standout success as an entire theatre was booked out with over 140 guests from the crypto and blockchain community attending. Starting off with networking and some photo opportunities, the event followed through with a panel discussion where Decred was a participant. We got the opportunity to share a lot of our collective views about the space and it was very well received by the guests. Furthermore, it was a great platform to showcase what Decred is about. The audience were a mix of all the key exchanges in the country, influencers in the community and peripheral service providers.

Following on from the panel session, we began the movie and we could not help ourselves but think about how similarly aligned Decredâ€™s messaging was in the panel and our overall marketing, in addition to the way the themes were dissected and portrayed in the documentary.

The creator of the film, Torsten Hoffmann is now embarking on a world tour to showcase the epic documentary, after which he will then work with key content distributors to make it available online for streaming and download. This certainly has the potential to be one of the main go-to documentaries for anyone interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain. We believe we have aligned ourselves to a great initiative and hope there is uptake from other Decred community leaders in other parts of the world to work with Torsten and his team.

As part of the sponsorship, Decred was showcased on a variety of promotional content ranging from photos, videos and audio recordings. We were also included in the official press release with @eSizeDave quoted on behalf of Decred.
