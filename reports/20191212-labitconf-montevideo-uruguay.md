## Overall experience

Labitconf is the most prestigious event about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain in Latin America. The event is designed to be a hot spot for networking between businesses in the cryptocurrency industries and to showcase new projects and ideas.

The conference was held in the Radisson Hotel of Montevideo, Uruguay, and gathered around 1000 visitors. The audience was mainly cryptocurrency professionals from a variety of projects and organisations. There was a small number of enthusiasts that attended to know more about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The professional audience that attended the conference was focused on exploring Business to Business opportunities (B2B). This set an interesting atmosphere to talk about business and collaborations to continue fostering the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Decred team at Labitconf included by @victorarubin and @elian from Mexico, @pablito, @nachito, @tomme, @camilolwi and @guido from Argentina. During two days the team got the chance to talk and network with all the companies and organisations that attended Labitconf, setting an interesting precedent for Decred project as this has been the largest team the project has sent to Labitconf. During the conference we got the chance to discover that our efforts during the past year were successful in terms of brand awareness and recognition. During the conference we could notice that practically all projects, both from Argentina and international, knew about Decred project. This is something that was perceived by all crew members both from Mexico and Argentina.

The team that traveled to Montevideo was ideal for the conference as we were able to present the project from different perspectives. Camilo, Guido and Tomee focused on education and investment, Elian and Victor were constantly explaining Decred's basics, Pablo and Nacho talked about selected topics on DCRComic and on the opportunities as Decred contractors. At the end of the day all the team talked about the project from different angles, something that allowed us to potentiate our message as all of us talked to every other project and organisation in the conference, giving a strong sense of unity and team work. There were no doubts that the Decred team made it self present at the conference and that we engage constructively with everyone in a way that there was always an interesting topic to talk about.

We can confirm that brand awareness has grown from the first occasion the project was presented in April in Cordoba, Argentina. Back in April there was only a few tech savvy individuals that knew about the project. This occasion in Montevideo, Uruguay, after 40 events through out the year, we recognise that more attendees knew about the project. We are certain that brand recognition in Argentina has grow exponentially after the 3 visits and 4 presentations of the project in the country. The perception of the general and professional public is that Decred is one of the projects in the space that is doing interesting and worthwhile innovations.

## DCR Comic prints

We made 100 A4 full-color prints for the event. This included Spanish and English versions of the first five DCR Comics (Politeia, PoW, DEX, PoS and Privacy). We had no booth, so we just handed them to whoever we talked to till we ran out of comics.

## Interactions

- Choose your own conversation:
  - Having five different DCR Comics allowed us to briefly present how diverse Decred is. After skimming through the comics, people usually asked about a particular topic and what Decred is doing.
  - In other cases, when we were the ones choosing the topic, having the comics allowed us to show we have points in common with a particular project. This is how we engaged with Zcash (Privacy), Signatura (DCR Time), Blockchain for Humanity (Politeia), Slush Pool (PoW / Ticket Rick), and other projects.
- This is a gift
  - We also gave comics to some of the key speakers of Labitconf. We talked about education with some and discussed how to approach the next generation of crypto users. Jimmy Song got a comic and was happy to see Stakey, Andreas Antonopoulos got a copy of each comic and liked them, Bitcoin Argentina NGO loved the idea of introducing 14-30 yo to crypto using cartoons.
- Asynchronous conversation
  - Even in a hurry, the comics allowed us to present a variety of Decred developments. If someone had to go, we kindly gave them comics to keep and read. At the end of each one, they have a link to the docs or the blog, our social media handles and Decred's site.

## Next time

Loose comics worked wonders, but it could be better. DCR Comic will put together a small magazine, fanzine or decredzine. This will include every comic up to that date and we could consider printing some great DCR blog posts, articles or even charts.

## No Booth

Not having a booth turned up nicely. At the event, we were the ones actively talking to people, no matter if they were walking around or at their own booth. This also gave us freedom to stay and talk where people were. Be that the first floor, the second one, or next to the main stage. We strongly suggest ALWAYS considering this kind of approach, unless there are planned activities for the booth like lightning talks, Decred 101 or QA. The booth should not be there waiting for someone to come, most of the team should be walking around engaging with others. Especially at costly events where the booth cost could be compared to hundreds of hours of development.

Overall, not having a booth allowed for the team to be free to go around the conference networking with attendees without having to be attached to a physical booth. On the one hand this strategy was perfect as we were able to be everywhere during the conference. On the other hand, as the team was big, it was impossible not to see us all over the place. I think for the next Labitconf conference it could be interesting to have a booth and to contrast the experience of the team.

In cases where the event is an expo of more than 4 days with dozens of thousands of attendees, like Web Summit or Talent Land, it is worthwhile to have a physical booth and a big Decred crew.

## Important Interactions

Some of the people and companies we got the chance to talk are:

- Andreas Antonopoulous - when asked about decentralised governance he acknowledged that governance is going to matter more over time as public blockchain grow.
- Jimmy Song - when asked about decentralised governance he mentioned that governance was unavoidably centralised and that term was in it self an oxymoron.
- Adam Back - we briefly talk and took a picture with Adam Back.
- Rodolfo Andragnes organiser of Labitconf and founder of Bitcoin Argentina, we had several conversations about the next Labitconf in Guatemala and the participation of Decred next year.
- Alejandro de la Torre VP from Poolin, we met and talk about the role of Poolin in Decred mining.
- Diego Saldivar CEO de RIF labs, founder of RSK.
- Pablo Coirolo from Aeternity Blockchain.
- Rocelo Lopes from Stratum.
- Pablo Gonzales CEO, Eduardo Arenas Listing Manager and Jose Rodriguez VP Payments from Bitso, we talked about new opportunities for Latin America, particularly the interest of Decred and Bitso in Argentina and Brazil.
- Tim Byun CEO OKCoin, Jim Nguyen VP Marketing, Oscar Muñoz Compliance Officer, Pablo Almagro Regional Manager Latam, we talk about having a cohosted event between OKCoin and Decred.
- Rafael Bonventi Client Success Specialist, Lane Fraum Account Manager at Kraken Exchange, talked about opportunities between Kraken and DCR and introduced to the listing team to follow up on the conversation.
- Staff from Houbi Global, we talked about having DCR listed in Houbi Argentina for next year as they are getting ready to start operation in Argentina.
- Fernando Gutierrez CMO, Ernesto Contreras Community Manager Latam Dash Core

## Interesting comments from attendees

- From Kraken staff: "I'm a maximalist and I think everything in the space is trash, but you guys (Decred) are doing interesting and innovative stuff, no doubts about it"
- From attendee: "hey you are from Decred! I recently saw Ticket Rick! Amazing work!"

## Decred should send key speakers to LATAM

Labitconf is dominated by community projects. There may be some corporate participants, like exchanges, but its organizers have a strong sense of community and like to give space to social impact projects. It is a great community that could be quite receptive to Decred's principles.
