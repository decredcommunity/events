## Overview

In Mexico City there is a very peculiar bar and the reason is because they accept cryptocurrencies as payment method. **The bar is a very important venue for crypto users in Mexico.**

Bitcoin Embassy celebrated its first anniversary, and through the great relationships the LATAM team has made with Bitcoin Embassy owners, they invited us to be present and sponsor the event. The event gave an opportunity to talk about Decred among the public and very active people in the crypto environment, such as co-founders and partners of the main exchanges in Mexico.

These meetings are very favorable for Decred, since every time people come to ask about the cryptocurrency and form of governance for themselves.

The event was also attended by members of crypto communities in some regions of the country. Many of them already knew Decred but the main idea is: **People who know about Decred get to know more.**

## Goals

- Strengthen relations with Bitcoin Embassy Mexico where they often host crypto meetings and talks about economy.
- Talk to the public about Decred, especially knowing what they know so far.
- Talk about Decred with very active members in the ecosystem such as co-founders of important exchanges in Mexico City, eliminate any doubts about Decred and discuss the proposal for LATAM.

## Evaluation

- The Decred team acted very well: @francov\_ , @victorarubin and @luisantoniocrag_ talked all night about Decred with most of event attendees.

## Learnings & Outcomes

- Mexican exchanges are increasingly interested in Decred, especially with Decred's growth plan in LATAM 2020. We hope to have more conversations soon.
- People who know the project now have a deeper knowledge about Decred's governance.
