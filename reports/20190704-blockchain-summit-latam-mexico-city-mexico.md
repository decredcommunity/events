## Overview

Blockchain Summit Latam is one of the leading conferences in Latin America with the objective of developing connections between entrepreneurs, developers and regulators of blockchain technology in the region. This year edition was held in Mexico City and Decred was one of the sponsors of the event and the project was presented in main stage on the first day of the conference. The audience was a mix of cryptocurrency professionals interested in expanding their business using blockchain and cryptocurrencies. It could be said that the percentage of people who were new to Bitcoin was only ~10%, meaning that the majority of attendees were well versed in the ecosystem. The Summit was the perfect place to learn more about the projects that are growing in Latin America and to make business with leaders of the industry in the region.

During this edition of Blockchain Summit Latam, Ana presented the project at main stage and went through its fundamental characteristics, the nuances of blockchain governance, Politeia, the contractor model and the advantages of having a Treasury to develop decentralised infrastructure. Decred had a keynote in which the main features and characteristics of the cryptocurrency, community and project were highlighted and introduced to the broader audience. Presentation rolled out smoothly and questions focused on Politeia and the usage of tickets for staking and on-chain and off-chain voting. It is important to note that Decred was the only SoV present at the event.

There were a total of 40 keynotes, 6 workshops, and 1 hackathon. Speakers came from all corners of Latin America, with a major presence from Colombia, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Attendees were mainly from Mexico.

Keynotes covered a great deal of topics in the ecosystem, like banking with Bitcoin and the disruption of the financial system, how to analyse and invest in these new kind of assets, the role of exchanges, regulation efforts, expectations from new protocols, decentralised applications, smart contracts, sidechains, transformation of public services with blockchain and use cases for Latin America, to name a few.

As for the social part of the event and networking, professionals and people into crypto instantly seemed to recognise Decred and many conversations started by gently praising Decred. For the opposite, an unusual situation happened when a small group of attendees pointed to us, the Decred community, questioning our presence and motives in Latam.

The event concluded in a private dinner named Ambassadors Dinner at the Bitcoin Embassy Bar in which Decred was the sponsor and swag was distributed among attendees, such as David Puell from Adaptive Capital, Josu San Martin from Sintax, Mauricio di Bartolomeo from Lend, Omar Zaragoza from Kapytal, Daniel Vogel and José Rodriguez from Bitso, among others. This event was the unofficial after party of Blockchain Summit Latam. There is no doubt that Decred presence was a success in creating brand awareness and building networks with the Latam ecosystem.
