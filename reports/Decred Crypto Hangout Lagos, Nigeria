## Overview
Oluwashina kicked off the event by welcoming the attendees and shared his story of how he was lured into the blockchain & crypto industry through Ponzi schemes like many other people but he took extra steps to learn the technical details of blockchain, everyone shared their story and we interacted for a while. Osho, a senior developer and Decred contributor spoke about Blockchain, Bitcoin, consensus algorithms, Limitations in proof of work, Decred, its governance feature and off-chain voting platform, politeia. He mentioned how proper governance and decentralized voting mechanisms is the most needed structure in the Nigeria economy. A particular question was asked saying ‘What is the roadmap of Decred in Nigeria, its intended use cases and how is it different from other speculative projects coming in everyday’ and a joint response was given saying ‘Decred is a proven project that offers a better store of value against the devaluing local currency and it is also a better, faster and cheaper means of cross border remittances. On the long term, we are looking at implementing decentralized voting systems such as politeia into national operations. At the moment we are focused on community building, constant education and awareness’. Michael, a junior developer and Decred contributor talked about the technical details of Decred. 
We had an interactive/ideation session where we discussed; how to drive the growth of Blockchain and cryptocurrency globally, Limitations encountered by projects launching in the space, careers and opportunities in the industry. Chiagozie Iwu, CEO of naijacrypto.com shared his experience and obstacles encountered in starting a local exchange with emphasis placed on the need for constant education and awareness or else, the industry will experience a heavy churn out rate. Emmanuel Ititim of Yellowcard spoke about the use cases of cryptocurrency with the most prominent ones being remittances and online payments. He talked about the challenges users face when buying into crypto e.g. unsafe, techy and expensive channels etc. until Yellowcard. Marshall of Telos4Africa shared the vision of Telos and how they plan to raise a community in Nigeria to build decentralized applications on Telos blockchain. 
We had more interactive sessions and engaged in networking sessions and pictures. The hangout ended at exactly 4:35 pm, we spent 3 hours learning, interacting and having an amazing time.




## Goals

Celebrate the 4th birthday of Decred.
Introduce Decred and its governance feature to the community.
Engage the attendees in interactive conversations to get real-time feedback on the direction and future of blockchain and cryptocurrencies (Decred in this case) in Nigeria.
Discuss the use cases of cryptocurrencies, on-ramp and off-ramp.


## Evaluation
The hangout was successful, participants learnt about Decred and its governance feature that makes it a better store of value. Education and Awareness is the most prized strategy at the moment to inform the general public about Blockchain and cryptocurrency. 
    

##  Learnings and Outcomes

A community-building approach to the marketing efforts of Decred in Nigeria is highly recommended, one of the ways to get people into the community is by partnering with a local media agency – cryptotvplus – who currently runs a program called CampusBCAT (Campus Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Awareness tour) where they visit tertiary institutions to teach the youths about Blockchain and cryptocurrency. A good marketing opportunity for Decred and source of data to build up the created community.
