## Overview
On November 21, the Decred meeting concluded in Veracruz, Veracruz.

The conference was divided into 3 presentations, @ Francov_ started with an introduction on blockchain and alternative digital economy, taking Bitcoin as a quick example, then @luisantoniocrag with a Decred introduction and then our partner Luis Miguel García who talked about tokenization. (Luis M. García is a contact we have thanks to the Monterrey blockchain community, who encourages us to attend the University and manages to open space for us).

The space was filled with 180 spectators of which 140 were initially occupied but after a hour and half many students began to leave because they had classes and only contemplated that time. At the end, 60 spectators stayed, leaving 30. From there we opened a panel of questions and that is where the interesting thing was put because we began to answer their questions, one of them that most struck me was about quantum computers, how it would affect long term to cryptocurrencies.

(It should be said that many of the spectator students who stayed until the end are doing their thesis in cryptocurrencies and blockchain) so the theme came in handy but what entertained us the most was that 2 public finance teachers and a systems man with whom we started a debate on Decred vs. Mexican peso attended the public.

If it is already complicated to discuss with Bitcoin maximalists, imagine with Fiat money maximalists.

The debate was so intense with reasonable arguments from each party that we kept those 30 spectators another 20 min more, in addition to taking advantage of distributing the Decred t-shirts they reached for everyone who had stayed.


Conclusion: the debate was very good because we gave points of view where there was evidence that "money" is a very volatile concept in human matters, but that we can correct all those details that have led us to make mistakes and we can land it and be objective thanks to the technological advance that we have, which makes it possible.

Create a decentralized economic alternative.

> As a curious anecdote, among the public was a professor who teaches systems at that same university, who also at the end debated why cryptocurrencies have no future, and his argument was based on the fact that cryptos are made of "faith of religion" because they will only work if people believe in him, but that that will be impossible because as money can be something that is not touched or seen, it is a blind faith.

> We debated for a while but at the end we realized that in technology in economics it is not up to date, has never made interbank transfers, does not handle credit cards or has used bank applications in addition to staying asleep at the conference 



## Goals

- Introduce the blockchain to university students in the area of ​​engineering and economics, due to the lack of information in this city.
- Introduce Decred Project, as an innovative and inclusive project to develop the economy in Mexico and LATAM.
- Teach about a blockchain governance model that is very different from the current political system of a traditional economy.
- Motivate economics students to study blockchain for payment methods and the implications.

## Evaluation
- The Decred presentation was good. In each meetup we are polishing the way to present decred.
- The presentations were good, and more fluid, although we would like to modify certain information to emphasize that cryptocurrencies are already a present reality and take away the idea that they are utopian projects.

## Learnings & Outcomes
- We learned how to debate and deal with people who disagree with cryptocurrencies more because of their ideology and not knowledge.
