#### Decred presence

- attendees: @arij
- webinar: "Blockchain Technology and Use Cases"

## Overall experience

I was invited to talk about blockchain technology and its use cases. I started with an introduction about why do we need blockchain technology, followed by a definition of blockchain, how it works, its history, hash functions, public vs private keys, consensus mechanism where I explained different types of consensus mechanisms and how Decred's hybrid PoW/PoS System work, different types of blockchains and at the end I gave some blockchain use cases in different fields.

The presentation took one hour, plus half an hour of Q&A.

At first, the participants thought that blockchain is cryptomoney, so I had to explain the difference between them and that crypto is just one use case of blockchain.

At the begining there were just 16 participants but more has joined in the middle of the webinar.

It was a great experience, talking about blockchain technology online, people are more at ease and they ask more questions.
