## Overview

53 participants attended the meetup out of 50 people who were expected.

@Joackim provided a brief introduction to blockchain.

We've intoduced participants to Decred, covering topis like what Decred is and where to store DCR coins. We've also helped some participants to install the wallet and make backups of the seeds.

Then we talked about how and where to buy DCR and further explained Decred features such as: hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus voting system, a censorship-resistant blockchain-anchored public proposal platform, cross-chain atomic swaps between different digital currencies and smart contracts.

Our meetup took place between 5:30 p.m. and 8 p.m., and contained both presentation and networking accompanied by some refreshments.
