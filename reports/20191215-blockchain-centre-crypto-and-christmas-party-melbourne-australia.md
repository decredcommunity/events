## Overview

In collaboration with The Blockchain Centre (Melbourne), Cointree, and e-Pocket, Decred Australia co-organised the Crypto & Christmas Party at Stone & Chalk FinTech and Innovation Hub (Melbourne).

It was a great way to to bring together the many facets of the cryptocurrency space in Melbourne. Quite a few of the key personalities from various professional elements of the cryptocurrency industry attended, along with an impressive many of the local Decred and broader cryptocurrency community.

Being primarily a social event, we had a fantastic opportunity to speak more directly with community members and industry players in a personable manner. Having such an opportunity enabled us to ignite the interest in Decred for those attending their first Decred affiliated event, and also to further stoke the interest of those already engaged with Decred.

We also had a speaking slot which was a great opportunity to present a very brief intro to Decred, present on Decred's achievements up to 2019, and primarily focus on the impressive progress Decred has made throughout 2019.

We had 10 Decred t-shirts to giveaway, and through our engagement with the crowd, we were selective of who we offered them to, selecting those whom we know didn't already have them, and in particular, those who best demonstrated their active interest in Decred.

This event was a great success, and we feel it will open the way for more professional opportunities for Decred, and it most certainly heightened the interest for Decred in the local cryptocurrency community.
