## Swag

* 400 stickers (4 different designs)
* 1000 A6 postcards (500 Decred, 500 Politeia)
* 1000 badges
* 100 tote bags
* 100 T-shirts (12 small, 52 medium, 20 large, 6 xl)

Notes:

* We had *far* too many stickers, badges and postcards. I would estimate we had half of the stickers, 800 badges and 650 postcards left over.
* We found the Decred postcards to be significantly more useful than the Politeia cards. Future events might consider taking a ratio of Decred/Politeia cards in a ratio like 75:25 instead of 50:50.
* T-shirts and tote bags were incredibly popular. We had 3 or 4 of each left over but that is because we weren't so generous with them on day one. We could have easily handed out 150-200 of each.
* Large and XL T-shirts were more popular than expected. A ratio of 10s, 40m, 30l, 10xl might be more appropriate. This is specific to UK. Different countries may have differently sized shirts/people.
* Not every Decred representative had proper business cards. Some had to write contact details onto the A6 size post cards and hand those out. Not having proper cards was inconvenient and sometimes seemed unprofessional.
* The printed decred.org on the buttons was really tiny - almost illegible. The white button with the Decred logo didn't have the web address at all.
* The back side of the T-shirts was plain - decred.org printed on the back would have been an improvement.
* The text on the postcards could really do with refreshing, and some of the fuzzy buzzwords can be cleaned up. We have a lot of cool things to talk about (privacy, LN, atomic swaps, ASICs, fork resistance) and none of these are covered by cards.

## Stand

* 3x3m stand is a great size for 3-4 Decred representatives to look after. With 2 people it can be difficult to talk to everybody, with 5 or 6 the stand was sometimes crowded and/or chaotic.
* The quality of the stand (build and design) was very high, and in my opinion stood out as one of the nicer looking stands at the Expo. Many stands looked quite bare, lacked design continuity or were poorly decorated/furnished.
* We didn't have a remote for the television. This made setting the TV up for video extremely difficult, and on day 2 we actually left the TV switched off. TV remote should be explicitly requested for future expos.

## Overall experience

* The stand was very busy almost all of the time. Footfall was good and we seemed to be talking to at least one interested party at all times.
* The number of people who visited us because they already know about Decred was staggering. I spoke to around 10-15 people who are staking, long-term holders and really knowledgable/supportive of the project.
* Apart from a couple of people who seemed to be patrolling the expo specifically looking for trouble, everybody seems very positive about Decred, and we seem to have a very good reputation in the industry.
* Most people assume Decred is the name of a company. Many questions about where the company is based, how many people are employed, are we currently hiring, how the company makes profit etc.
* Many people patrolling the expo specifically looking for ICOs they can invest in. These people often had no interest in DCR.
* Barely anybody knows Lightning Network. Those who do know about it seem extremely skeptical or only know the very surface details.
* I didn't speak to a single person who had heard of cross chain atomic swaps. Once explained, people seemed *extremely* excited about it.
* It would be a valuable skill to know how to get rid of people at the stand. Some people stay for faaar to long and consume a lot of valuable time. It's frustrating to see VIPs walk past and not be able to chat with them because you are tied up with somebody else.
* I met very few developers/technically savvy people at the expo - only 2-3.

## Notes by @Ani

Here are some of the most common questions from people who didn't know about Decred yet:

* Where is Decred based?
* What is your long-term goals for the project, do you want to be the second Bitcoin?
* Where can I use Decred to buy things? And what are other use cases for using Decred?

So these questions showed me that there is somewhat a gap in understanding about the autonomous and decentralised nature of Decred, the long-term goals and use case of Decred. I assume this is normal given the early days of crypto in general and our marketing focus being more geared towards early adopters and more tech savvy people. However, it is something that needs to be considered sooner rather than later, because ultimately, we want people to use Decred.
