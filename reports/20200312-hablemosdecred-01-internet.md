## Overall experience

We organized this first virtual meetup before the "online event craze", mainly to address those LATAM community members who live in countries where there's no established Decred community to host meetups. There was plenty of interest and one third of the attendees was new to Decred.

Being the first one we did not prepare talks, we just chatted and met people who joined the Decred en Espa√±ol room at Decred's Discord server. @elian, @pablito and @adcade gave a quick informal intro to Decred and then answered questions that came up.

Most questions were related to the Proof-of-Stake voting system Decred has. Those who had some prior knowledge of cryptocurrency asked how to stake, and those who didn't wanted to know more about voting rights and what can stakeholders do with their tickets.

Topics covered:

- Decred as an organization and it's culture
- Communication channels
- Contractors
- Ticket system
- Ticket splitting
- Smartcontracts and scripting in Decred and other chains (ETH)
- DCR Time

It worked out fine, but decided to include some talks at the beginning of the next HablemosDecred.

## About Virtual Meetups

In the first Spanish virtual meetup we had at least five people new to the project who wanted us to organise some kind of event near their cities but couldn't because we don't have the resources to do it. For the rest it was a "follow up" from past regular meetups. At least for the LATAM community they may have some use. I believe we will host at least a couple more to have some sort of measure about the impact and what are we getting from it.
