## Reflection

Guest speakers talked about Decred:

* Kin, guest speaker, TomoChain team member, said "Decred is awesome, of course everyone here (Vietnam) will know about it." and "I really like Decred. I have followed it since 2017."

* Joeri van Geelen, Founder and CEO of Build Blocks Group, when talked a bout Decred: "awesome project! I have invested in Decred for a long time (2 years and a half)".

* Many Vietnamese speakers are just learning about Decred.

About Cointime Summit 2019:

* Presentations were back to back. We introduced Decred to people individually who we met in the conference area.

* Almost all of the coins which were mentioned in the conference are in lower ranks in comparison to Decred. But their communities are really big and active in Ho Chi Minh City. "Our community has meeting every week".

* Most of the speakers talked about the potential of Vietnamese market. They all believe in the bright future of crytocurrency here.

* Postcards, trifolds, stickers: each was given out 23 copies in the first day and 35 copies in the second day of the event.

About Vietnam Staking Economy:

* Smart strategies: download hushkeyhub and receive TOMO via airdrop (2 rounds to keep people stay till the end); answer questions and get airdrop. That we can learn from them.

* International blockchain week - the biggest event about blockchain in China - is coming. Decred team in China should go.

* I had 1 hour in break time to make contacts, a lot of young people actively talked to me, asked me questions while I was talking to others about about Decred. Many others curiously looked at the Decred T-shirt. They might know or want to know more about Decred.

Host our own conference.

Because:

* Next time we should plan to have a booth so we can get more attention.
* Many Vietnamese young people are interested in coin market.

Ideas:

* We should host one in Hanoi and one in Ho Chi Minh city. If we do it in a university, I can help with that. Last year, our law research club invited a Ministry of Justice staff come to teach about cryptocurrency, there were almost 200 students join and they asked a lot of questions. They were all interested in the topic.

* We can do some invitation letters to invite some important people to come and speak. I can help with inviting the staff of Ministry of Justice to come and give a talk about crypto currency and Vietnamese regulation of it. He has certain impact on law students.

* I told Kin that maybe in the future we can cooperate to host a conference or some programs. He was really excited and said that he would love to since he really likes Decred. He has followed Decred since 2017. TomoChain team is willing to join hands with us.

* Mr Joeri Van Geelen, Founder & CEO of Build Blocks Group, offered to contribute to our conferences if we host ones in the future.

About our postcards and trifolds, we should have QR code on our postcards and trifords. It should be much easier to reach to our sites.

About our team: Vietnamese team is too small (only 2 people) while Decred deserves a much bigger community. I propose a pressing request to grow a proper Vietnamese community and to host a real conference of our own in the near future.

How far we got:

* We have doubled our members to 30 people from different areas in the [@decredvietnam](https://t.me/decredvietnam) Telegram group.
* After the events, we came up with future strategy which is to continue with the new partnerships in Ho Chi Minh City as well as continue to expand in Hanoi by some contacts we made with ([KTS Group](http://ktsgroup.io) - [Kiem Tien So](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TienSo/)). They are interested in partnering with Decred and help our community grow strongly in both the North and South of Vietnam. These following contacts could also help with that and be used in the next Decred projects in Vietnam.
