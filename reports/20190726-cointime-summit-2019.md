## Reflection

* Guest speakers talked about Decred: 

Kin, guest speaker, tomochain team member, said "Decred is awesome, of course everyone here (vietnam) will know about it.". "I really like Decred. I have followed it since 2017."

Joeri van Geelen, Founder and CEO of Build Blocks Group, when talked a bout Decred :"awesome project! I have invested in Decred for a long time (2 years and a half)".

Many vietnamese speakers are just learning about Decred.

* About the first event:

Presentations were back to back. We introduced Decred to people individually who we met in the conference area.

Almost all of the coins which are mentioned in the conference are in lower ranks in comparison to Decred. But their community is really big and active in Ho Chi Minh City.  "Our community has meeting every week"

Most of the speakers talked about the potential of Vietnamese market. They all believe in the bright future of crytocurrency here. 

Postcard, Trifold, Sticker, each was given out 23 copies. 

* About the second event:

Smart strategies: download hushkeyhub and receive tomo via airdrop (2rounds to keep people stay till the end); answer questions and get airdrop. That we can learn from them.

International blockchain week - the biggest event about blockchain in China - is coming. Dcr team in China should go. 

There were too many people but I could not talk to all of them. I had 1 hour in break time to make contacts.

Postcard, Trifold, Sticker, each was given out 35 copies. 

* Host our own conference. 

Because:

Next time we should plan to have a booth so we can get more attention.

Many Vietnamese young people are interested in coin market

Ideas: 

We should host one in Hanoi and one in Ho Chi Minh city. If we do it in a university, I can help with that. Last year, our law research club invited a ministry of justice staff come to teach about cryptocurrency, there were almost 200 students join and they asked a lot of questions. They were all interested in the topic.

We can do some invitation letters to invite some important people to come and speak. I can help with inviting the staff of Ministry of Justice to come and give a speech about crypto currency and Vietnamese regulation on it. He has certain impact on law students. 

I told Kin that maybe in the future we can cooperate to host a conference or some programs. He was really excited and said that he would love to since he really likes Decred. He has followed Decred since 2017. Tomochain team is willing to join hands with us. 

Mr Joeri Van Geelen, Founder & CEO of Build Blocks Group, offered to contribute to our conferences if we host ones in the future.

* About our postcards and trifolds, we should have QR code on our postcards and trifords. It should be much easier to reach to our sites.

* About our team: Vietnamese team is too small (only 2 people) while Decred deserves a so much bigger community. I propose a pressing request to grow a proper Vietnamese community and to host a real conference of our own in the near future. 

* How far we got:

We have doubled our members to 30 people from different areas in the @decredvietnam telegram group. 

After the events, we came up with future strategy which is to continue with the new partnerships in Ho Chi Minh City as well as continue to expand in Hanoi by some contacts we made with (KTS Group: http://ktsgroup.io - https://www.facebook.com/groups/TienSo/). They are interested in partnering with Decred and help our community grow strongly in both the North and South of Vietnam. These following contacts could also help with that and be used in the next Decred projects in Vietnam.
