## Overall experience

The third Hablemos Decred virtual meetup gathered a small part of the Spanish community. Aside from the Decred team there were very few new community members from Argentina, Poland and Spain in the Jitsi room.

@elian talked about the Proof-of-Stake voting system, explained how tickets work. @pablito covered what are Voting Service Providers, how to use one and recommended safeguards, the need for ticket splitting and its current implementation.

The QA section that followed led into a discussion about coin ownership, vote delegation and the new staking service offered by KuCoin, which also led into the current DeFi ecosystem and it's risks.

## Lessons learnt

Attendance dropped significantly.

We had published the previous events in much more social media groups and channels but didn't want to spam that much. At the same time, decided to host it earlier, at the afternoon, assuming more people would attend.

18 PM could still be the best time to host these meetups, just like regular meetups. Also, there are more online events than ever and competition for people's free time has increased. A community member from Spain pointed out that most companies in the country were hosting online events.

There's lots of room for improvement in developing better online events formats to ensure that even people who have a busy schedule can attend.

Setting up video/audio recording ensures that even when attendance is low, there's a return for the time investment. Also, those interested but who didn't make it can go through the recording.
