Overall experience: I was invited by Legal Hackers Medellin to talk on a panel about the implications and challenges of blockchain technology to international law in EAFIT University, biggest business administration university in Colombia. The panel was also integrated by Jhonny Gomez from Blockchain Centre Colombia and Pablo Santos from Finaktiva. The panel was organised as part of a larger event with different panels that talked about the implication of exponential technologies on the law. The majority of students that attended the panel were on their 4th or 5th semester of law school. 

The panel started with a brief on what is Bitcoin, Decred and Blockchain technology. After this introduction I talked about the qualities of a DAO and how the ethereal essence of these organisations challenge the very notion of the State and social organisation. In terms of the challenges that the DAOs suppose to International Law it is interesting to notice that the traditional legal frameworks to understand an organisation tend to be insufficient to explain the reach and inner working of a DAO. 

The students were really interested in the challenges that DAOs suppose to the nation State, if DAOs are everywhere there is internet connection and nowhere physically stablished, the very notion of an organisation is put into question in regards of the traditional forms of legal frameworks used to establish public and private relations. The students were interested on the necessary qualities for a DAO to exist, also they were interested to understand better what are the social and technological qualities of a DAO. 

There was also plenty of interest on the use case of dcrtime as a time stamping mechanism for notarisation of documents and the extent to which this kind of technological tools can in fact des-intermediate legal procedures that are currently expensive and time consuming.
