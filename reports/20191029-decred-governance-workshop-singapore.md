## Overview

A rare Decred event was held in Singapore at WeWork with @joshuam and @zohand presenting to an intimate crowd - deep diving into blockchain governance and sound money.

The presentation started with a basic run through of the principles of governances as it has been interpreted and practiced over the centuries, and then it proceeded to defining sound money and the features it holds. The presentation then went on to showcase both Decred's governance model as well as its overall design. Many case examples were shared and the audience found the content to be highly informative.

Decred is relatively unknown in the Singapore community as the major Alts and more ETH related projects have taken the spotlight. We made sure to spend our efforts pre-event in connecting with the appropriate community leaders and crypto investors and builders to ensure they were participating in the event. In addition to this, we have got their attention and are now in a better position to run future events with the insights we have gained.

The crowd we drew was very well versed in the crypto and blockchain sphere, and that ended up turning the Q&A session into an hour long discussion where we cut through a lot of areas within governance, technology and cryptocurrency. It was in-depth and the ideas that were shared were of a very high calibre.

They have asked for a follow up session in the future and have all suggested that we should partner with other communities to draw in a bigger and more diverse crowd in the future.
