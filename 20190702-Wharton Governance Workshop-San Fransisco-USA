## Format and Summary

The event took the format of a roundtable discussion with 2 small group breakout workshops on Day 1 and Day 2 respetively.  

### The first day's conversations centered around:

1. Governance Theory
2. Blockchain Governance in Practice
3. Perspectives on Blockchain Governance
4. Working Group Discussions

We had lively conversations that set the tone for a very interactive event.  Various definitions of governance were put forth and the conversations delved into Governance theory and attempted to reach some consensus around what Givernance is.
A few key questions that emerged from the day were: Can one build scalable governance? Can governance be portable? Can governance be built that is not succitable to plutocracy or some form of capture by the wealthy or powerful?

There was general agreement that every cryptonetwork has a governance system whether it thinks so or not.  Networks that do not explicity develop and seek to adhere to a self determined governance process will have one imposed on it.
We discussed wide ranging themes on how a governance structure determines the culture that emerges in networks and sets the trajetory of the community.  It was also determined and agreed to by some that it becomes increasingly harder to impose an explicit governance structure on a community that does not outline a process at its onset, once a system is capured, its very difficult to change governance course.

We spent quite a bit of time trying to define stakeholders. There was a camp that wanted an expansive definition that included all of society and others who wanted in to be more limited to individuals with skin in the game or at least a direct interest in the network (i.e. miners, contractors, token holders etc)

Decred occupied a good portion of airtime dusing the conversation about governance in practice.  The conversation started with a well detailed summary of how the Segwit process went down in the Etherum communty.  This provided the opportunity to contrast Etherum and Decred which I an a number of other participants galdly jumped on.
Phrases like: "If Etherum has a clear and transparent governance process like Decred...." were used to highlight the value of an explicit and transparent process (decred) vs an opaque (Etherum) process.

We talked about the importance of skin in the game and transaprency, delegated governence vs  non-delegared systems, principal - agent problems etc.

To close out the day there was a spirited conversation on Public blockchains as a public utility.  Issues of social reponsibility, unintended consequences, unacounted for "stakeholders" were discussed.


### The second day's conversations centered around

1. Refining and finalizing outputs from working group discussions
2. Attempting to pull together a blokchain givernance framwork by reaching consensus on key issues
3. Next steps to the project should take to advance the state of understanding and pracice around blockchain governance

The group was divided into 5 working groups to discuss and flesh out the following:

1. The context of blockchain governance: The Who? What? When? and Why?, How does blockchain governance differ in permissioned vs permisionsless networks? How blockchain-based contexts differ from traditional software engineering, open source, or corporate governance?
2. Measurement and Quality: What are the attributes of successful blockchain governance and how can success be measured?
3. Governance of vs By Blockchain: How blockchain systems are governed from how blockchains are employed as governance solutions for the world. How does the internal governance structure of a blockchain platform or community influence its effectiveness for managing resource allocations, asset registries, commercial ecosystems, etc.?  
4. Behavioral and Institutional dynamics: How can the insights of economics and related fields help to design decentralized ecosystems? What role do digital assets play in incentive schemes and how can they be linked to the overall network governance? What agency conflicts can arise in multiple protocol and/or stakeholder ecosystems and how can they be identified in the design process? What patterns do projects using token incentives share? 
5. The Governance Stack: Compose a first high-level draft of a blockchain governance outline to serve as a discussion basis for the whole-group session on the second day. Included not only identifying the relevant layers and other components which are likely to be shared by most projects, but also framed the discussion by highlighting specific focus areas worth assessment by the whole group.
