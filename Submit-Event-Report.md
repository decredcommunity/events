This is a work in progress. Use this template to write up your experience of events you have attended to share the knowledge with the community. 

## Report on an event you attended
### Where to submit
In the main repo, under the 'reports' folder, find the .md file for the event you are reporting on. If one does not exist, create a new file with the naming convention: YYYYMMDD-name-city.md. Use hyphens instead of spaces in event or city names. 

For example if you attended Consensus 2018 in New York, the report file would be called 20180514-Consensus-2018-New-York.md.

Either add to the relevant parts of the write up or use the following template if you are the first to report on the event:

This format is a work in progress. If you would like to suggest a modification to this template please [create a new issue](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/issues/new).
